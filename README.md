# goup

This is a quick Go program to install or upgrade your Go runtime by downloading the latest release from golang.org:

    % sudo goup
    You are running Go 1.10.1 for linux (amd64)
    Go 1.10.3 linux amd64 is available in tar format
    Download and install? y
    Downloading go1.10.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    Fetching https://dl.google.com/go/go1.10.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    Downloaded and SHA256 checked
    Go upgraded successfully
    % go version
    go version go1.10.3 linux/amd64
    %

It should work for macOS and Linux, patches for Windows compatibility would be welcomed.

## Features

 - Interactive
 
 - Examines versions to see if there's an upgrade

 - Checks SHA256 checksums
 
 - Checks byte count of download

 - Not a shell script
 
 - Sets read permissions on unpacked files for use from `sudo`
 
 - Allows you to override arch or OS
 
 - Now usable for initial install, if you have a built binary of it
 
## Bugs and limitations

 - Slurps the entire downloaded distribution file into RAM.

 - Doesn't work on Windows yet.

 - If the Go team distributes a tar file that doesn't have everything under a top level "go" directory, it'll fail 
   (and leave junk in your destination directory).

 - Doesn't attempt to manage having multiple different versions of Go installed at the same time. If you need that, try [gvm](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm) or use `go get` to [install specific versions](https://golang.org/doc/install#extra_versions).
